Hi, I'm Bikathi Martin. I was born an raised in Kenya. I am a 24 year old Fullstack developer, with an interest in VueJS, 
NuxtJS and SPring Boot. Recently, I have been getting into Rust development and I am in the process of moving away from web development 
(as least using the traditional tech stack like the aforementioned ones).

I created this entire blog using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with the [Serene](https://github.com/isunjn/serene) theme as a base. 
This blog is an archive of the many things I have learnt in the world of coding and software engineering. Many of the tutorials
on it will be related to Rust, Java, Spring Boot and Vue/NuxtJS. Feel free to use the links above to email me or checkout my LinkedIn page.
